      'In the postwar years, Danish designers and architects believed that design could be used to improve people’s lives. In the late 1940s, the growing middle class in Denmark began to show interest in Danish Modern and helped fuel further investment into the style.',
      'Particular attention was given to creating affordable furniture and household objects that were both functional and elegant. Fruitful cooperation ensued, combining Danish craftsmanship with innovative design. Initially, the furniture was handmade, but recognizing that their work would sell better if prices were reduced, the designers soon turned to factory production.',

      'Sales peaked around 1963, but when American manufacturers introduced moulded plastic and wood-grained Formica as cheaper substitutes, they started to decline in favor of “Mediterranean” designs which became popular in 1966. In addition to changes in style preferences, customers shopping habits had changed to favor affordable and lower-cost furniture over a single investment that would last their lifetime.',
