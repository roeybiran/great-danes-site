      'Aksel Bender Madsen, often known simply as Bender Madsen, was a Danish furniture designer who worked closely together with Ejner Larsen producing a wide variety of items during the Danish modern period.',
      'Born on 16 August 1916 in Ringe on the Danish island of Funen, Madsen was the son of farmer Niels Martin Madsen. After training as a cabinetmaker, he attended the Furniture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 1940. Thereafter he worked with architects Kaare Klint and Arne Jacobsen until 1943.',
      'From 1942, he designed his own models which he exhibited at the annual Cabinetmakers Guild’s exhibitions in Copenhagen. While studying at the Academy, he met Ejner Larsen who became his partner. In 1947, they established a design studio together. The same year, they presented works made by cabinetmaker Willy Beck at the Cabinetmakers Guild’s exhibition in Copenhagen where they continued to participate year after year, working with Beck for a total of 25 years. In addition to sculptural chair designs, they also designed living rooms, bedrooms, shelving, dining tables, and office furniture. Their most notable work is the Metropolitan Chair, in bent plywood, which was exhibited in 1949 and manufactured by Fritz Hansen from 1952. All their works have a clear, timeless, simple style which continues to please today.',

    bio: [
      'Arne Jacobsen was born on February 11, 1902 in Copenhagen. His father, Johan Jacobsen, was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother, Pouline Jacobsen, was trained as a bank clerk and often painted floral motifs in her spare time. The family lived in Claessensgade, Copenhagen in a typical Victorian style home. Maybe that is why Arne, as a child, painted the coloured wallpaper in his room white, as a contrast to his parents’ overly decorated taste.',
      'At Nærum Boarding School, he met the Lassen brothers; later, Flemming Lassen was to become his partner in a series of architectural projects. Arne Jacobsen was described as a restless pupil, always up to pranks, and often with a self-deprecating humour. Already as a child, he showed an extraordinary talent for drawing and depicting nature through scrupulous studies. Originally, Jacobsen wanted to be painter, but his father felt that architect was a more sensible choice, and that is how it was. Nevertheless, Jacobsen later had ample opportunity to paint and to express his ideas through highly accurate drawings.',
      'Jacobsen’s travelling began already in his twenties, when he went to sea. The voyage, the only one in his career as a sailor, went to New York. Then followed an apprenticeship as a bricklayer in Germany and a series of study and drawing excursions to Italy. During this period, Jacobsen produced some of his finest watercolours with classic motifs, where he captures atmospheres and renders materials and shapes accurately and carefully. From the beginning of his career, Jacobsen turned his gaze abroad, without ever abandoning Denmark or the Danish traditions in his field.',
      'In summarising Jacobsen as a person, one arrives at a picture that reflects to a high degree the nuances in his purely professional production: On the one hand the insistent, perfectionist modernist, to whom no detail was trivial, although the main picture was basically black/white and unambiguous. On the other hand, the nature-loving botanist and jovial family man. Overall, the professionalism and almost nerdy passion for his work are indispensable aspects in descriptions of Jacobsen - including his own descriptions.',

      'Arne Vodder was trained by Finn Juhl, who became his friend and business partner. Before concentrating on furniture alone, in 1951 he opened his own studio with the architect Anton Borg. Together they designed some 1,100 low-cost houses which proved to be a great success. In the 1950s and 1960s, at a time when Denmark was receiving international recognition for its furniture, he designed a wide range of items. Despite the originality and timelessness of his style, he is not as well known as contemporaries such as Børge Mogensen and Arne Jacobsen. Yet his works are simple and modest, crafted in natural materials such as rosewood and teak and, in particular, are free of sharp edges.',
      'From the 1950s, Vodder worked with the furniture company Sibast on several sets of office furniture which did particularly well on the American market, even arousing the interest of Jimmy Carter. In the 1960s, the furniture not only reached the White House but could be seen in banks, airline offices, embassies and hotels across the globe. Vodder also arranged international exhibitions in Sweden, England, Austria and the United States together with Verner Panton and Nanna Ditzel. Vodder worked with a number of manufacturers including Cadovius, Nielaus, Erik Jorgensen, Fritz Hansen, Sibast furniture and latterly Kircodan in Bangkok.',

He taught at Denmark’s Design School (1973–78) and was lector at the Royal Danish Academy’s Furniture School (1978–85). Bernt’s furniture designs were mainly in light wood such as ash and beech. Some of his pieces have been used in theaters and concert halls in towns throughout Denmark. Petersen was recognized for his simple style which is suitable for industrial production.

He believed in visual clarity and minimal decoration or experimentation, as seen in his classic Hunting Table and Deck Chair Set.',
      'As a student at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Mogensen was inspired by Kaare Klint’s use of human proportions with visual calm and functionalism. Mogensen, however, also placed emphasis on informal interior décor and the use of modern production facilities.',
      'Mogensen completed his cabinetmaker training in 1934, followed by studies in furniture design. During this period he worked in the studios of Klint and Mogens Koch until he was hired as chief designer for the Danish furniture cooperative FDB in 1942, where he pioneered democratic design.',
      'He began his own design studio in 1950, making modern, useful furniture produced from local, Nordic materials. His inspiration, however came from many cultures and styles, including international modernism, ethnic arts, Japanese carvings, and historic works.',
      'Mogensen also taught furniture design and participated in exhibitions and competitions, such as the 1948 International Competition for Low- Cost Furniture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which he entered together with his friend Hans J. Wegner.',
      'He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1950 and won the Danish Furniture Prize in 1971. In 1972 he was awarded the C.F. Hansen Medal and appointed Honorary Royal Designer for Industry at the Royal Society of Arts in London.',

      'They specialized in furniture design, presenting their work at the annual exhibitions of the Cabinetmakers Guild, organised by Edvard from 1943 to 1966. Their pieces for factory production were rather simple in design but they also designed more elaborate individual pieces. Kindt-Larsen was fascinated by the idea of contrasts, as can be seen in his furniture where he often combined glossy painted surfaces with untreated wood or simply used several different kinds of wood for a given item.',
      'The couple also designed home textiles for Gabriel in Fredericia and silverware for A. Michelsen. A silver bracelet designed in 1952 was relaunched by Georg Jensen as a watch in 1993. Kindt-Larsen also worked as an architect. Of particular merit is the house he designed for himself in Klampenborg (1949). He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1949.',

After training as a cabinetmaker, he learnt furniture design at the Design School in Copenhagen, qualifying in 1940. Thereafter he worked with furniture designers Mogens Koch, Peter Koch and Palle Suenson. From 1942, he designed his own models which he exhibited at the annual Cabinetmakers Guild’s exhibitions in Copenhagen.',
      'While studying under Kaare Klint at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, he met Aksel Bender Madsen who became his partner. In 1947, they established a design studio together. The same year, they presented works made by cabinetmaker Willy Beck at the Cabinetmakers Guild’s exhibition in Copenhagen where they continued to participate year after year. In addition to sculptural chair designs, they also designed living rooms, bedrooms, shelving, dining tables, and office furniture. Their most notable work is the Metropolitan Chair, in bent plywood, which was exhibited in 1949 and manufactured by Fritz Hansen from 1952. All their works have a clear, timeless, simple style which continues to please today.',

      'Finn Juhl was born on 30 January 1912 to an authoritarian father who was a textile wholesaler representing several English, Scottish and Swiss textile manufacturers in Denmark, and a mother who died shortly after he was born. From an early age he wanted to become an art historian, already as a teenager spending much time at the National Gallery and in spite of his young age receiving permission to borrow books at the library of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, but his father disapproved his aspirations which he considered flimsy and convinced him instead to pursue a career in architecture. He was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1930 to 1934 he studied under Kay Fisker, a leading architect of his day and noted lecturer.',
      'After graduating, Juhl worked for ten years at Vilhelm Lauritzen’s architectural firm, where he had also apprenticed as a student. In close collaboration with Viggo Boesen, Lauritzen’s closest, Juhl was responsible for much of the interior design of the national Danish broadcaster Danmarks Radio’s Radio Building, one of the firm’s most high-profile assignments during those years. In 1943 he received the C.F. Hansen prize for young architects.',
      'In 1945 he left Vilhelm Lauritzen’s company and set up his own design practice, in Nyhavn in Copenhagen, specializing in interior and furniture design. However, his work in furniture design began earlier than that.',
      'Juhl made his debut in 1937 when he commenced a collaboration with cabinetmaker Niels Vodder which would continue until 1959 and exhibited at the Cabinetmakers’ Guild Exhibitions, the 11th of its kind. Therefore, his early chairs were originally produced in small numbers, eighty at most, because the Guild-shows emphasized the work of the artisan over the burgeoning industry of mass production. However, they were almost all reissued later in his career.',

The competition that arose between them led to a constant renewal and reinterpretation of furniture craftsmanship on both sides.

Born in 1931 in a small town of Braband in Denmark, Hans Bølling attended an Art- and Handcraft School originally to become an advertising designer, however some years later he followed his passion for architecture and graduated as an architect from the Royal Danish Art Academy.',
      'Hans Bølling designed a plethora of art works, ranging from wooden figurines, wooden animals and furniture to villas, living complexes and town halls. Oscar the Dog and his Duck came to life in the 1950s during Hans Bølling’s younger years, following the architect’s interest in nature and animals. Here he decided to create small figures of animal figurines for his loved ones. Later, after winning an award he received a carpentry machine, which afforded him the opportunity to carve his beloved figures into wood. It is at this point during the Danish spring that the Mermaid, Dog and the Duck, and later its offspring - the Hans Bølling Duck and Duckling, were born.',

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer.',
      'From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.',

      'Risom was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 8 May 1916. His father was a prominent architect, Sven Risom, a member of the school of Nordic Classicism. Risom was trained as a designer at the Copenhagen School of Industrial Arts and Design (Kunsthåndværkerskolen), where he studied under Ole Wanscher and Kaare Klint. He was classmates with Hans Wegner and Børge Mogensen.',
      'Risom spent two years at Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College, before beginning work as a furniture developer and interior designer with the architectural firm of Ernst Kuhn. He later relocated to Stockholm, taking a job with a small architectural firm. From there he joined the design department of Nordiska Kompaniet where he was introduced to Alvar Aalto and Bruno Mathsson.',
      'In 1939, Risom traveled to New York City to study American design. He found it difficult to find work as a furniture designer in New York, however, and was forced to accept a number of textile designs that ultimately secured him freelance work with designer Dan Cooper. This led to his work being included in the Collier’s “House of Ideas” designed by Edward Durell Stone and constructed in front of Rockefeller Center during the 1939 New York World’s Fair.',

      'Born in Roskilde, Kastholm first trained as a smith but soon turned to furniture design. He attended the School for Interior Design in Copenhagen where he studied under Finn Juhl. At the beginning of the 1960s, working in Lebanon, he was inspired to design the Scimitar Chair. He also furnished the SAS office there.',
      'It was while studying at the Design School that Kastholm met cabinetmaker Preben Fabricius who became his partner for a number of years. They had a common approach to furniture design, never wanting to compromise on quality. Speaking of their partnership, Kastholm commented: “We had the same basic approach, we both wanted to minimize. I had been to the United States and seen furniture by Eames and Mies van der Rohe and it inspired us. The simplest lasts longest. At school we had learnt that timelessness was an ideal.',
      'The pieces of furniture they produced during their seven-year period of cooperation from 1961 to 1968 were so distinctive that many are still produced today as classics. As a result of disagreements, the pair decided to terminate their cooperation in 1968.',
      'Kastholm was later appointed professor at Bergische Universität in Wuppertal near Düsseldorf where he taught design from 1975 to 1996. He also designed furniture at his office in Germany as well as in his house in the mountains on the island of Majorca. He returned to Denmark shortly before he died in June 2007.',

      'Recognized as the father of modern Danish design, Kaare Klint designed icons such as the 1914 Faaborg Chair and the 1933 Safari Chair, as well as the design for the reception room of the Danish Pavilion at the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition.',
      'As the son of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, Kaare Klint was immersed in architecture from an early age, but made his mark on Danish design history as a furniture designer and educator. In 1924, he helped establish the Department of Furniture Design at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. As associate professor and later professor, he inspired some of the greatest Danish furniture designers and architects – including Hans J. Wegner, Mogens Koch, Arne Jacobsen and Poul Kjærholm – who would continue shaping the Golden Age of Danish design from the early 1940s. Today, Klint is regarded as a reformer: as one of the first designers to put functionalism and the practical study of architecture and furniture design principles above style, he redefined a period otherwise characterized by style-focused academic teaching.',
      'Klint had an outstanding sense of proportion and space, and created “human furniture” based on studies of the human body. He studied an object’s uses over its form, and renewed Danish furniture design by refining tradition and developing objects perfectly in relation to their primary purpose. Klint was also aware of designs’ relationship to its environment, insisting his pieces never dominate a space, but unite form and function for a greater whole.',
      'In all his work, he insisted on clear, logical design, clean lines, the best materials, and superb craftsmanship. Klint earned many accolades, including the Eckersberg Medal in 1928 and the C.F. Hansen Medal in 1954. In 1949, he became an Honorary Royal Designer for Industry in London.',

      'Danish designer Kai Kristiansen was born in 1929. Like many of Denmark’s design greats, he apprenticed in cabinetmaking before enrolling—around 1948—in the prestigious Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen under the highly influential designer Kaare Klint. At the age of 26, Kristiansen opened his own studio and began to create furniture in what would soon became known as the Danish modern style. His designs would be produced by well-known Danish manufacturers, such as Feldballes Møbelfabrik, Fornem Møbelkunst, Fritz Hansen, and Magnus Olesen.',
      'In true Danish modern fashion, Kristiansen favored well-joined teak and rosewood, evident equally in his chairs, desks, sideboards, and wall units. In 1956, he designed his most celebrated work, the No. 42 Chair for Schou Andersen. The organically curved back and pivoted armrests form a chair that is as beautiful as it is comfortable. The No. 42 was well- received by critics and enjoyed continued success as one of the most enduring Danish designs of the 20th century.',
      'Because they were so difficult to manufacture, many of Kristiansen’s designs eventually went out of production. In 2014, Kristiansen collaborated with Miyazaki Chair Company in Japan to reimagine some of his classics designs, which resulted in the Handy Chair, 4110 Chair, and Paper Knife seating collection.',

Particularly fond of working with oak, often combined with leather, he designed many special sets of furniture for ships, hotels, cinemas and nursing homes. His distinctive designs aroused widespread international interest, resulting in his work being exhibited in New York’s Museum of Modern Art.',

      'Mogens Koch’s designs reveal some of the most elegant and important solutions to the requirements of function, comfort and aesthetics. Koch’s works – which included homes, monuments, building extensions, graphic design, objects for the home and, of course, furniture – stand out as original examples of universal utility.',
      'From 1925 to 1932, Koch was inspired by the principles of Danish functionalism in a number of design studios – including Kaare Klint’s. Koch’s patient study, analytical mind and creative spirit resulted in functional solutions, showing a clear simplicity of form that respected and built on the work of previous generations. A focus on essential structural components and mathematics also played key roles in Koch’s process. Traditional ornamentation and decoration for its own sake were not part of his ideology – an object’s purpose led the way.',
      'In order to capture meaning and create mathematical order, Koch developed the modular concept for one of his major design successes: his Bookcase System, with dimensions based on the most common book heights. His Folding Series is similarly renowned for its versatility, detail, and functionality based on everyday needs and the space constraints of modern living.',
      'The Bookcase System design – initially developed for Koch’s own home – offered a highly flexible, practical storage solution. In 1928, he drew the first sketches for the core square module, offering a minimalist aesthetic and intelligent, varied storage.',
      'Following Klint’s ideologies, Koch’s Bookcase System has succeeded in bringing everyday home objects into graphic order for over 80 years.',
      'Koch was an influential professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from 1950 until 1968. His numerous awards include the Eckersberg Medal in 1938, the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1963, and the ID Prize in 1992.',

Applying a similar, experimental approach, Lassen designed homes whose rooms were shaped by both function and the daylight flooding in through the windows, and where outdoor spaces were just as carefully designed as the interiors.',

His work, which from 1944 was carried out mainly in partnership with Peter Hvidt at the Hvidt & Mølgaard studio, can be divided into three groups: furniture and interior decoration, buildings, and consultency on large bridge projects.',
      'Hvidt & Mølgaard’s pioneering sets of furniture included Portex (1945) and Ax (1950), based on a laminating technique and produced by furniture maker Fritz Hansen. The chairs were specially designed for export, economizing on space and packaging requirements for transportation. Hvidt & Mølgaard increasingly took on architectural assignments (from 1970 together with Hans Kristensen). Projects covered office buildings and factories, including the De Danske Sukkerfabrikker Building in Copenhagen (1958), as well as collective housing projects in Søllerød, Hillerød and Birkerød (1962–1970), all completed in a light, clear and simple style. The firm also acted as consultants on the new Little Belt Bridge (1970) and the Vejle Fjord Bridge (1980), playing an important part in the success of their designs.',

      'Moos designed a bed that could slide in and out of his window so that he could sleep in the fresh air. He worked in a special way, finding the wood he needed himself and making his furniture before drafting the plans. His pieces, which were made to order, were unique in their elegance. His style is reminiscent of art nouveau but more delicate and refined. Working mainly with wood, he would sand his pieces several times with very fine sandpaper, washing them off each time. This resulted in an especially fine finish. In place of nails and screws, he used dowels and wedges in another kind of wood, creating special effects almost like marquetry. He only created some 30 to 40 pieces, but each one is quite distinctive.',

      'Through his work as an architect and teacher, Poul Kjærholm became an international design figure and key representative of modernism. He combined his strict, modern idiom with an uncompromising approach to quality and materials rooted in Danish craftsmanship traditions. Despite his short career as a furniture designer, Kjærholm’s exquisite craftsmanship and clear expression resulted in timeless designs whose influence extended globally and well beyond his own lifetime.',
      'Kjærholm became known for his modernist steel, leather and glass furniture. After training as a cabinetmaker, he studied furniture design at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, graduating in 1952.',
      'Kjærholm returned as a lecturer in 1955, succeeding Ole Wanscher as professor in 1976. He remained at the Academy until his death in 1980, influencing through his work and teaching both within and outside the Academy.',
      'Just like Kaare Klint, Kjærholm removed unnecessary ornamentation in favor of clarity and function – the hallmarks in his work as both an educator and a designer. He avoided easy solutions and fads in his search for each material’s own language. Kjærholm’s linear aesthetic and expression were influenced by global pioneers such as Gerrit Rietveld, Mies van der Rohe and Charles and Ray Eames.',
      'In the post-war years, Kjærholm distanced himself from the rounded, organic shapes of contemporary Danish design. As industrialization took off, Kjærholm felt that Denmark could only industrialize production if its products were technically superior to their traditionally crafted counterparts – he sought new ways to unite tradition and innovation.',
      'Kjærholm’s furniture is represented in many international museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His awards include the Lunning Award in 1958, the Eckersberg Medal in 1960, and multiple ID Prizes.',

      'Fabricius was trained as a cabinetmaker by Niels Vodder before attending the School for Interior Design where he studied under Finn Juhl. It was there that he met the blacksmith Jørgen Kastholm. They had a common approach to furniture design, never wanting to compromise on aesthetics. In 1961, the pair set up a design studio in a Gentofte cellar without any firm arrangements with manufacturers. In 1965, they exhibited at the furniture fair in Fredericia where the German furniture manufacturer Alfred Kill noticed their work. Kill had a reputation for high quality but initially Favricius and Kastholm were not keen to design furniture for factory production. Only when Kill offered them DM 2,500 a month each, with no preconditions, did they agree to work for him. They travelled to Stuttgart with their first designs for production in Kill’s factory in nearby Fellbach. Their international breakthrough came at the Cologne Fair in 1966 when they exhibited a whole series of office and home furniture leading to orders from ten large furniture concerns. Their minimalistic designs, both attractive and comfortable, were usually in steel and leather. The Tulip Chair, the Grasshopper Chair and the Scimitar Chair are among their most successful works. Fabricius died in March 1984 when he was only 52.',

The building’s architect, Helge Bojsen-Møller, was reluctant to allow a young lady to handle the assignment but Andersen, appreciating the nature of the task, created a series of simple, almost timeless pieces of furniture and carefully developed plans for the different rooms: the assembly hall, the library and 56 bedrooms.',

By fusing the elements of a room – floor, walls, ceiling, furnishings, lighting, textiles and wall panels made of enamel or plastic – into a unified gesamtkunstwerk, Panton’s interior installations have attained legendary status. The most famous examples are the ’Visiona’ ship installations for the Cologne Furniture Fair (1968 and 1970), the Spiegel publishing headquarters in Hamburg (1969) and the Varna restaurant in Aarhus (1970).',
      'Panton’s collaboration with Vitra began in the early 1960s, when they jointly developed what became his best-known design, the Panton Chair, which was introduced in 1967. This was also the first independently developed product by Vitra.',
      'Verner Panton died in 1998 in Copenhagen. Vitra’s re-edition of designs by Panton, as well as the retrospective of his work mounted by the Vitra Design Museum in 2000, bear witness to the special relationship between Vitra and Verner Panton.',
