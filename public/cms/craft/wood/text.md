# Wood

The Danes’ remarkable relationship with wood goes a long way back, to the times of the Vikings and their expert shipbuilders. Rulers came and went; industries shifted focus — wood, however, remained a core substance taking part in nearly every aspect of the Danish peoples’ daily lives. This long-established connection to wood and the abundance of forests in Denmark allowed the Danes to develop an unparalleled mastery of this marvelous material.
