Mogens Koch’s designs reveal some of the most elegant and important solutions to the requirements of function, comfort and aesthetics. Koch’s works – which included homes, monuments, building extensions, graphic design, objects for the home and, of course, furniture – stand out as original examples of universal utility.

From 1925 to 1932, Koch was inspired by the principles of Danish functionalism in a number of design studios – including Kaare Klint’s. Koch’s patient study, analytical mind and creative spirit resulted in functional solutions, showing a clear simplicity of form that respected and built on the work of previous generations.

A focus on essential structural components and mathematics also played key roles in Koch’s process. Traditional ornamentation and decoration for its own sake were not part of his ideology – an object’s purpose led the way.

In order to capture meaning and create mathematical order, Koch developed the modular concept for one of his major design successes: his Bookcase System, with dimensions based on the most common book heights. His Folding Series is similarly renowned for its versatility, detail, and functionality based on everyday needs and the space constraints of modern living.

The Bookcase System design – initially developed for Koch’s own home – offered a highly flexible, practical storage solution. In 1928, he drew the first sketches for the core square module, offering a minimalist aesthetic and intelligent, varied storage.

Following Klint’s ideologies, Koch’s Bookcase System has succeeded in bringing everyday home objects into graphic order for over 80 years.
Koch was an influential professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from 1950 until 1968. His numerous awards include the Eckersberg Medal in 1938, the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1963, and the ID Prize in 1992.
