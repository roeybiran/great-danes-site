Kay Bojesen’s Monkey comprises 31 parts and is made of limba wood and sustainable teak. Every single member of the monkey family is produced in Denmark, and is absolutely unique. It’s a beloved classic of Scandinavian design.

This monkey is made of teak and legally harvested limba wood complies with the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR). The plantation teak guarantees responsible harvesting and better living conditions for locals living close to the plantations.

Bojesen’s monkey with its mischievous look and light coloured belly has transformed kids’ rooms into jungles and sparked dreams of far-away places since 1951. It has a permanent role on Danish television as the mascot of wildlife programs and as a prize in quiz shows. Every monkey consists of 31 wooden parts and is crafted by hand in Denmark. Due to slight variation in shade and wood grain, the monkeys have a unique and charming personality.

Over time, exposure to the light and the air may change the subtle shades of the teak to a more consistent, warm golden brown tone. However, every single Kay Bojesen Monkey will retain its absolutely unique personality.
