Furniture designer Ib Kofod-Larsen was born Denmark in 1921 and studied at the Danish Royal Academy in Copenhagen. In 1948, he won the Holmegaard glass competition as well as an annual award from the Danish Cabinetmakers Guild. The latter drew the attention of Danish furniture manufacturer Faarup Møbelfabrik, and Kofod-Larsen went on to create some of his most beautiful works for the company, including his rosewood Model 66 sideboard, during the 1950s. He also designed furniture for several other leading midcentury manufacturers, both at home and abroad, including High Wycombe, Christensen & Larsen, Carlo Gahrn, Bovenkamp, Petersens, and Fredericia Furniture.

Kofod-Larsen passed away in 2003. Today, the designer’s pieces have become more frequently collected, in large part due to Kofod-Larsen’s talent for honoring the innate qualities of his chosen materials.
