The son of a farmer, he attended Askov HÃ¸jskole, a folk High School, before training as a cabinetmaker in Jutland and later in Copenhagen. From 1926 to 1929, he worked in Paris, Geneva and Lausanne. In 1935, he moved into Bredgade in Copenhagen where he started his own workshop which he maintained for 20 years. He attended evening classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Einar Utzon- Franck and Kaare Klint.

Moos designed a bed that could slide in and out of his window so that he could sleep in the fresh air. He worked in a special way, finding the wood he needed himself and making his furniture before drafting the plans. His pieces, which were made to order, were unique in their elegance. His style is reminiscent of art nouveau but more delicate and refined. Working mainly with wood, he would sand his pieces several times with very fine sandpaper, washing them off each time. This resulted in an especially fine finish. In place of nails and screws, he used dowels and wedges in another kind of wood, creating special effects almost like marquetry. He only created some 30 to 40 pieces, but each one is quite distinctive.
