Helge Vestergaard Jensen was a Danish furniture designer whose work is characterized by its minimized constructions in order to obtain simple and elegant results. Vestergaard Jensen is most famous for his 1955 daybed design, which was made in an limited edition likewise his other furniture designs. Eventhough Vestergaard Jensen is not particular well known among the public, his furniture designs are highly demanded because of the limited numbers and his sense of craftsmanship, detail and his uncom-promising approach to his design, which was never massproduced. Vestergaard Jensen collaborated with the skilled cabinetmaker Peder Pedersen and together they were regular exhibitors at the Cabinet makersâ€™ Guild Exhibitions where always set new standards for what one might expect of a piece of furniture.
