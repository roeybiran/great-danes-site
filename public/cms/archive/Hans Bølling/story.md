Famous for his mid-century modern themed Danish wooden toy figurines, Bølling enjoyed the connection between design and fun like many of his Danish contemporaries, including Kay Bojesen.

Born in 1931 in the small town of Braband in Denmark, Hans Bølling originally attended an art school to become an advertising designer, however some years later he followed his passion for architecture and graduated as an architect from the Royal Danish Art Academy.

Hans Bølling designed a plethora of art works, ranging from wooden figurines, wooden animals and furniture to villas, living complexes and town halls. Oscar the Dog and his Duck came to life in the 1950s during Hans Bølling’s younger years, following the architect’s interest in nature and animals. Here he decided to create small figures of animal figurines for his loved ones.

Later, after winning an award he received a carpentry machine, which afforded him the opportunity to carve his beloved figures into wood. It is at this point during the Danish spring that the Mermaid, Dog and the Duck, and later its offspring—the Hans Bølling Duck and Duckling, were born.
