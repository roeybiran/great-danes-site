Erik Ole Jørgensen had an instinct for tactility in textiles as well as in his furniture design. Originally, Erik Ole Jørgensen was educated as a furniture upholsterer, but upgraded his skills by educating himself as an architect too.

His talent for composing patterns and textiles has ensured that his designs have achieved the status of classics. They are as relevant today as when first designed.

With a focus on the entire process from the first drawings to the completed product, Erik Ole Jørgensen designed furniture with simple functional elegance.
